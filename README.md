# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 
Machine learning can make accurate, quick, and reliable selections for loan applicants. We will evaluate multiple machine learning models to decide which one will give us the best results for predicting credit risk.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
